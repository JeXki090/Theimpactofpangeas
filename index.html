	<center><h1>The impact of Pangea</h1></center>






	<h1>The breakup of Pangea had a significant impact on the Earth's climate, biodiversity, and evolution. As the landmasses moved apart, they created new ocean basins and changed the patterns of ocean currents. This, in turn, affected the Earth's climate and led to the formation of new ecosystems.
The breakup of Pangea also allowed for the evolution of new species, as isolated populations of plants and animals adapted to their new environments. This process ultimately led to the incredible biodiversity we see on Earth today.</h1>
